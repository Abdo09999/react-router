Implement `<AbsoluteRoutes>`/`useAbsoluteRoutes` as alternatiuves to `<Routes>`/`useRoutes` when using absolute paths is required. This is primarily intended to be used to ease migrations from v5 applications where this was a common pattern. It's also useful for descendant routes when you want to manage your paths in an external data structure.
